So I did this because it was funny to me cuz. My teacher gave us an assignment in "Computer" to make a form, yes my school teaches programming cool for me but i'm not sure for the others tho, anyways so I thought to myself. _"Hey wouldn't be funny i inserted Javascript!"_ and that's what I did. But before you ask my teacher only thought use `HTML` and `CSS` soo I'm really advanced coder.
