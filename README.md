# Context

So I did this because it was funny to me cuz. My teacher gave us an assignment in "Computer" to make a form, yes my school teaches programming cool for me but i'm not sure for the others tho, anyways so I thought to myself. _"Hey wouldn't be funny i inserted Javascript!"_ and that's what I did. But before you ask my teacher only thought us `HTML` and `CSS` soo I'm a really advanced coder.

The code I send to my teacher is inside the `not_modified` folder. And if you ask why I am modifiying the current code cuz its funny and I want to enhanced my coding skills and fix some stuff.
